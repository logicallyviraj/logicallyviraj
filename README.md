# 🙏 Namaste! I'm Viraj.

I aspire to create **simple, human-centered applications** that make people's lives easier.  
I genuinely believe that **good software** should be like a good conversation -  
clear, thoughtful, and accessible to everyone.

### What I'm Currently Exploring
- ⚛️ **React** - for building beautiful, intuitive UIs that just *feel right*
- 🐍 **Python** - for scripting, automation, and unlocking backend/AI possibilities
- 🎯 Writing cleaner, more maintainable code with **TypeScript**
- 🧠 Building habits around consistency, learning in public, and real-world problem solving
